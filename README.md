# fertitta's CS:GO Config Files

These files are mostly borken up logically to what they controll, making it easy to find and tweak a single setting.

Putting these files on git hub was inspired by https://github.com/samersultan/csgo and samersultan's cfg files were used as a reference

# Nade Practice #

The nade practice config is to help use nades, it removes all bots, binds "n" to noclip, binds "p" to give nades. Use by typing "exec nadepractice" into the console

# Nade Script

nadescript.cfg executes the [nadetraining script](https://github.com/s-ol/csgo-vscripts), it allows you to save nades so all others will follow the same path. Useful for pop flash training. 
To use this place nadetraining.nut in your scripts/vscripts directory
